## TraceProofreading

**Trace Proofreading** is a machine learning based method for detection and correction of topologcal errors in automated neuron tracing projects.


## Summary
Our understanding of synaptic connectivity in the brain relies on the ability to accurately trace sparsely labeled neurons from 3D optical microscopy stacks of images. A variety of algorithms and software tools have been developed for automated neuron tracing, but the resulting traces often contain topological errors such as broken and incorrectly merged branches. Trace proofreading is an automated trace method that utilizes machine learning to correct trace topology.


## Topological errors in initial automated traces of neurites
Traces of neurons obtained from 3D optical microscopy stacks of images unavoidably contain topological errors such as broken branches, which result from the non-uniform intensity of neurites, and fused branches, which arise from branch proximity and a relatively low resolution of light microscopy.

## Dataset
The results of this study are based on the analyses of the dataset of Neocortical Layer 1 Axons featured at the DIADEM challenge. It consists of 16 3D stacks of images (512×512×33-60 voxels) of fluorescently labeled axons of multiple layer 6 neurons imaged with a two-photon microscope in layer 1 of the mouse visual cortex.
